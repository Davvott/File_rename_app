# File Rename
============================================================================

Tk implementation, with class'.

After having completed the tk 'webscraper' tute, I realised I could port the GUI outline to my rename app. The GUI 'frames' have been placed in their own classes just for a bit of class practice.

No Drag 'n Drop. The DnD module is too hectic to slot in. Instead the Listbox functionality provides a means for moving through folders and files. So directory traversal occurs through the interface itself. Popup functionality was a lot easier to implement. But, it's not in a Class system yet. I copied the tutorial's naming convention for _internal_variable._ This probably hasn't been done appropriately. 

As said before, use at your own risk!

ToDo:
- Info popup msg
- Save / retrieve settings
- Clear log on startup
