**File Rename**

Tk implementation. Classless atm.

After having completed the tk 'webscraper' tute, I realised I could port the GUI outline to my rename app. At the moment the GUI components are sitting in main(), but a Class refactor is on the way. 

No Drag 'n Drop. The DnD module is too hectic to slot in. Instead the Listbox functionality provides a means for moving through folders and files. So directory traversal occurs through the interface itself. Popup functionality was a lot easier to implement. But, it's not in a Class system yet. I copied the tutorial's naming convention for _internal_variable._ But this probably hasn't been done appropriately. 


ToDo:
- Build class structure for GUI and logic
